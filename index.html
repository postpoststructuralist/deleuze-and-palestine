        <p>Hi! This is a portable website where I record encounters between Deleuze's philosophy and Palestine. This came about because of an essay I discovered on Deleuze and Palestine, where I learned that many of Deleuze's writings on Palestine were suppressed in his canonization. I would like to record those pieces somewhere.</p>

        <h2>"The troublemakers" - Gilles Deleuze (1978)</h2>
        <p>Why would the Palestinians be "valid negotiators" since they do not have a country? Why would they have a country, since theirs has been taken? They have never been given any other choice than to surrender unconditionally. They have been offered only death. In the war that opposes them to Israel, Israel's actions are considered legitimate reprisals (even if they appear disproportionate), while those of the Palestinians are treated exclusively as terrorist crimes. And an Arab death has neither the same value nor the same weight as an Israeli death.</p>
        <p>Since 1969 Israel has continuously bombed and shelled South Lebanon. Israel explicitly recognized that the recent invasion of that country was not a reprisal for the Tel Aviv commando action (thirty thousand soldiers against eleven terrorists) but the premeditated, crowning moment of a whole series of operations whose initiative Israel reserved to itself. For a "final solution" to the Palestinian problem, Israel can count on the almost unanimous complicity of other states, with a variety of nuances and restrictions. The Palestinians, people with neither land nor state, are seen as troublemakers by everyone. No matter how many weapons and how much money they have received from certain countries, they know what they are saying when they declare that they are absolutely alone.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian combatants also say that they have just won a certain victory. They had left only resistance groups in South Lebanon, groups which seem to have held up quite well. On the other hand, the Israeli invasion struck blindly at Palestinian refugees, Lebanese peasants, all the poor agricultural people. The destruction of villages and cities, massacres of civilians have been confirmed; the use of cluster bombs (<i>bombes &agrave; billes</i>) has been reported in several quarters. For several years this South Lebanese populace has been continuously fleeing and returning, in perpetual exodus, under Israeli blows that cannot very clearly be distinguished from terrorist acts. The current escalation has driven two hundred thousand people onto the roads without shelter. The state of Israel is applying to South Lebanon the method that proved itself in Galilee and elsewhere in 1948: it is "palestining" South Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian combatants are drawn from the refugees. Israel claims to defeat the combatants only by turning thousand of others into refugees, among whom new combatants will be born.</p>
        <p>It is not only our relations with Lebanon that make us say that the state of Israel is murdering a fragile and complex country. There is also another aspect. The Israel-Palestine model is determinant in current problems of terrorism, even in Europe. The worldwide understanding among states and the organization of a world police force with worldwide jurisdiction, currently under way, necessarily lead to an expansion in which more and more people are classified as virtual "terrorists." We find ourselves in a situation analogous to that of the Spanish Civil War, when Spain served as laboratory and experimentation for a still more terrible future.</p>
        <p>Today, the state of Israel leads the experimentation. It is establishing a model of repression that will be converted for other countries, adapted by other countries. There is a great deal of continuity in itst politics. Israel has always considered that the UN resolutions which verbally condemned it in fact proved it right. It transformed the invitation to withdraw from the occupied territories into the duty to establish colonies there. Currently it considers the deployment of the international force in South Lebanon an excellent idea... on the condition that this force is ordered to transform the region into a surveillance zone or a controlled desert. It's an odd kind of blackmail, which the whole world will give up only if there is sufficient pressure to ensure that the Palestinians are finally recognized for what they are, "valid negotiators," since they are in a state of war for which they are most certainly not responsible.</p>

        <h2>"The Indians of Palestine" - Gilles Deleuze and Elias Sanbar (1982)</h2>
        <p><b>Deleuze:</b> Something seems to have ripened on the Palestinian side. A new tone, as if they have overcome the first state of their crisis, as if they have attained a region of certainty and serenity, of "right" (<i>droit</i>), which bears witness to a new consciousness. A state which allows them to speak in a new way, neither aggressively nor defensively, but "equal to equal" with everyone. How do you explain this since the Palestinians have not yet achieved their objectives?</p>
        <p><b>Sanbar:</b> We have felt this reaction since the appearance of the first issue. There are the actors who said to themselves, "look, the Palestinians are also doing journals like this," and that has shaken a well-established image in their heads. Don't forget that for many people the image of the Palestinian combatant for which we claim responsibility has remained very abstract. Let me explain. Before we established the reality of our presence, we were perceived as refugees. When our resistance movement established that our struggle was one to be reckoned with, we were trapped once again in a reductive image.</p>
        <p>Multiplied and isolated to infinity, it was an image of us as pure militarists, and we were perceived as doing only that. It's in order to leave that behind that we prefer our image of combatants to that of militiamen in the strict sense.</p>
        <p>I believe that the astonishment which the appearance of this journal has provoked also comes from the fact that certain people must now begin to admit to themselves that the Palestinians exist and that simply recalling abstract principles does not suffice. If this journal comes from Palestine, it nonetheless constitutes a terrain on which multiple pre-occupations are expressed, a place where not only Palestinians take the floor but also Arabs, Europeans, Jews, etc.</p>
        <p>Above all, certain people must begin to realize that if there is such a labor as this, such a diversity of horizons, it probably must also include, at other levels of Palestine, painters, sculptors, workers, peasants, novelists, bankers, actors, business people, professors... in short, a real society, of whose existence this journal gives an account.</p>
        <p>Palestine is not only a people but also a land. It is the link between this people and their despoiled land, it is the place where an absence and an immense desire to return are enacted. And this place is unique, it's made up of all the expulsions that our people have lived through since 1948. When one has Palestine in one's eyes, one studies it, scrutinizes it, follows the least of its movements, one notes each change which awaits it, one adds up all its old images, in short, one never loses sight of it.</p>
        <p><b>Deleuze:</b> Many articles in the <i>Revue d'&Eacute;tudes Palestiniennes</i> recall and analyze in a new way the procedures by which the Palestinians have been driven out of their territories. This is very important because the Palestinians are not in the situation of colonized peoples but of evacuees, of people driven out. You insist, in the book you are writing, on the comparison with the American Indians. There are two very different movements within capitalism. Now it is a matter of taking a people on their own territory and making them work, exploiting them, in order to accumulate a surplus: that's what is ordinarily called a colony. Now, on the contrary, it is a matter of emptying a territory of its people in order to make a leap forward, even if it means making them into a workforce elsewhere. The history of Zionism and Israel, like that of America, happened that second way: how to make an empty space, how to throw out a people?</p>
        <p>In an interview, Yasser Arafat marks the limit of this comparison, and this limit also forms the horizon of the <i>Revue d'&Eacute;tudes Palestiniennes</i>: there is an Arab world, while the American Indians had at their disposal no base or force outside of the territory from which they were expelled.</p>
        <p><b>Sanbar:</b> We are unique deportees because we haven't been displaced to foreign lands but to the continuation of our "own place." We have been displaced onto Arab land where not only does no-one want to break us up but where this idea is itself an aberration. Here I'm thinking of the immense hypocrisy of certain Israeli assertions which reproach the other Arabs with not having <i>"integrated"</i> us, which in Israeli language means <i>made us disappear"</i>.... Those who expelled us have suddenly become concerned about alleged Arab racism with respect to us. Does this mean that we have not confronted contradictions in certain Arab countries? Certainly not, but still these confrontations were not the results of the fact that we were Arabs; they were sometimes inevitable because we were and are an armed revolution. We are also the American Indians of the Jewish settlers in Palestine. In their eyes our one and only role consisted in disappearing. In this it is certain that the history of the establishment of Israel reproduces the process which gave birth to the United States of America.</p>
        <p>This is probably one of the essential elements for understanding thosse nations' reciprocal solidarity. There are also elements which signify that during the period of the Mandate affair we did not have the customary "classical" colonization, the cohabitation of settlers and colonized. The French, the English, etc. ... wished to settle spaces in which the presence of the natives was the condition of existence of these spaces. It was quite necessary that the dominated be there for domination to be practiced. This created common spaces whether one wanted them or not, that is to say networks, sectors, levels of social life where this "encounter" between the settlers and the colonized happened. The fact that it was intolerable, crushing, exploitative, dominating does not alter the fact that in order to dominate the "local," the "foreigner" had to begin by being "in contact" with that "local."</p>
        <p>Then comes Zionism, which begins on the contrary from the necessity of our absence and which, more than the specificity of its members (their membership in Jewish communities), formed the cornerstone of our rejection, of our displacement, of the "transference" and substitution which Ilan Halevi has so well described. Thus for us were born those who it seems to me must be called "unknown settlers," who arrived in the same stride as those whom I called "foreign settlers." The "unknown settlers" whose entire approach was to make their own characteristics the basis of a total rejection of the Other.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I think that in 1948 our country was not merely occupied but was somehow "disappeared." That's certainly the way that the Jewish settlers, who at that moment became "Israelis," had to live the thing.</p>
        <p>The Zionist movement mobilized the Jewish community in Palestine not with the idea that the Palestinians were going to leave one day, but with the idea that the country was "empty." Of course there were certain people who, arriving there, noticed the opposite and wrote about it! But the bulk of this community functioned vis-&agrave;-vis the people with whom it physically rubbed shoulders every day as if those people were not there. And this blindness was not physical, no one was deceived in the slightest degree, but everyone knew that these people present today were "on the point of disappearance," everyone also realized that in order for this disappearance to succeed, it had to function from the start as if it had already taken place, which is to say by never "seeing" the existence of the other who was indisputably present all the same. In order to succeed, the emptiness of the terrain must be based in an evacuation of the "other" from the settlers' own heads.</p>
        <p>In order to arrive there, the Zionist movement consistently played upon a racist vision which made Judaism the very basis of the expulsion, of the rejection of the other. This was decisively aided by the persecutions in Europe which, led by other racists, allowed them to find a confirmation of their own approach.</p>
        <p>We think moreover that Zionism has imprisoned the Jews, it's taking them captive with this vision I just described. I'm saying that it's taking them captive and not that it took them captive at a given time. I say this because once the holocaust passed, the approach evolved, it was transformed into a pseudo-"eternal principle" that says the Jews are always and everywhere "the Other" of the societies in which they live.</p>
        <p>But there is no people, no community which could claim&#8212;and happily for them&#8212;perpetually to occupy this position of the rejected and accursed "other."</p>
        <p>Today, the other in the Middle East is the Arab, the Palestinian. And the height of hypocrisy and cynicism is the demand, made by Western powers upon this other whose disappearance is constantly the order of the day, for guarantees. But we are the ones who need guarantees against the madness of the Israeli military leaders.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the PLO, our one and only representative, has presented its solution to the conflict: the democratic state of Palestine, a state which would tear down the existing walls separating all the inhabitants, whoever they may be.</p>
        <p><b>Deleuze:</b> <i>Revue d'&Eacute;tudes Palestiniennes</i> has its manifesto, which appears in the first two pages of Issue #1: we are "a people like others." It's a cry whose meaning (<i>sens</i>) is multiple. In the first place, it's a reminder or an appeal.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians are constantly reproached for refusing to recognize Israel. Look, the Israelis say, they want to destroy us. But the Palestinnians themselves have struggled for more than 50 years to be recognized.</p>
        <p>In the second place, it's in opposition to the Israeli manifesto, which is "we are not a people like others," by reason of our transcendence and the enormity of the persecutions we have suffered. Hence the importance, in Issue #2 of the <i>Revue</i>, of two texts on the Holocaust by Israeli writers, on Zionist reactions to the Holocaust, and on the significance that the event has acquired in Israel, in relation to the Palestinians and the entire Arab world that were not involved in it. Demanding "to be treated as a people outside the norm," the state of Israel maintains itself all the more completely in a situation of economic and financial dependence upon the West such that no other state has ever known (Boaz Evron). This is why the Palestinians hold fast to the opposite claim: to become what they are, that is, a completely "normal" people.</p>
        <p>Against apocalyptic history, there is another sense of history that is only made with the possible, the multiplicity of the possible, the profusion of possibles at each moment. Isn't this what the <i>Revue</i> wants to show, even and above all in its analyses of current events?</p>
        <p><b>Sanbar:</b> Absolutely. This question of reminding the world of our existence is certainly full of meaning, but it's also extremely simple. It's a sort of truth which, when truly admitted, will make the task very difficult for those who have looked forward to the disappearance of the Palestinian people. Because, finally, what it says is that all people have a kind of "right to rights" (<i>droit au droit</i>). This is an obvious statement, but one of such force that it very nearly represents the point of departure and the point of arrival of all political struggle. Let's take the Zionists, what do they say on this subject? Never will you hear them say, "the Palestinian people have no right to anything," no amount of force can support such a position and they know it very well. On the contrary you will certainly hear them affirm that "there is no Palestinian people."</p>
        <p>It's for this reason that our affirmation of the existence of the Palestinian people is, why not say it, much stronger than it appeared at first glance.</p>

        <h2>"The grandeur of Yasser Arafat" - Gilles Deleuze (1983)</h2>
        <p>The Palestinian cause is first and foremost the set of injustices that these people have suffered and continue to suffer. These injustices are acts of violence, but also illogicalities, false reasonings, false guarantees that claim to compensate or vindicate them. Arafat needed only one word to describe the broken promises, the violated agreements, at the moment of the Sabra and Shatila massacres: <i>shame, shame</i>.</p>
        <p>It's said that this is not a genocide. And yet it's a story that consists of many Oradours, from the very beginning. Zionist terrorism was practiced not solely against the English, but on the Arab villages which had to disappear; Irgoun was very active in this respect (Deir Yasin). From beginning to end, it involved acting as if the Palestinian people not only must not exist, but had never existed.</p>
        <p>The conquerors were those who had themselves suffered the greatest genocide in history. Of this genocide the Zionists have made an <i>absolute evil</i>. But transforming the greatest genocide in history into an absolute evil is a religious and mystical vision, not a historical vision. It doesn't stop the evil; on the contrary, it spreads the evil, makes it fall once again on other innocents, demands reparation that makes these others suffer part of what the Jews suffered (expulsion, restriction to ghettos, disappearance as a people). With "colder" means than genocide, one ends up with the same result.</p>
        <p>The United States and Europe owed reparation to the Jews. And they made a people, about whom the least that could be said is that they had no hand in and were singularly innocent of any holocaust and hadn't even heard of it, pay this reparation. It's there that the grotesque begins, as well as the violence. Zionism, then the state of Israel will demand that the Palestinians recognize its right (<i>droit</i>). But the state of Israel will never stop denying the very fact of a Palestinian people. They will never speak of Palestinians but of the Arabs of Palestine, as if they found themselves there by chance or in error. And later, they will act as if the expelled Palestinians came from outside, they will not speak of the first war of resistance that the Palestinians led all alone. Since they haven't recognized Israel's right, they will be made into descendants of Hitler. But Israel reserves the right to deny their existence in fact. Here begins a fiction that had to stretch further and further, and to weigh on all those who defended the Palestinian cause. This fiction, this wager of Israel's, was to make all those who would contest the <i>de facto</i> conditions and actions of the Zionist state appear as anti-Semites. This operation finds its source in Israel's cold politics with respect to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>From the start, Israel has never concealed its goal: to empty the Palestinian territory. And even better, to act as if the Palestinian territory were empty, always destined for the Zionists. It was clearly a matter of colonization, but not in the nineteenth-century European sense: the local inhabitants would not be exploited, they would be made to leave. Those who remained would be made, not into a dependent territorial workforce, but rather into a mobile and detached workforce, as if they were immigrants placed in a ghetto. From the start, lands are bought on the condition that they be empty of occupants, or can be emptied. It's a genocide, but one in which physical extermination remains subordinated to geographical evacuation: being only Arabs in general, the surviving Palestinians must go merge with the other Arabs. Physical extermination, though it may or may not be entrusted to mercenaries, is most certainly present. But this isn't a genocide, they say, since it's not the "final goal": in reality, it's just one means among others.</p>
        <p>The complicity of the United States with Israeel does not arise solely from the Zionist lobby. Elias Sanbar has shown clearly how the United States rediscovered in Israel an aspect of its own history: the extermination of the Indians which, there as well, was only in part directly physical. It was a matter of emptying, as if there had never been Indians except in the ghettos which were made for them as immigrants from inside. In many respects, the Palestinians are the new Indians, the Indians of Israel. Marxist analysis reveals the two complementary movements of capitalism: constantly to impose limits, within which it develops and exploits its own system; and always to push these limits farther back, to exceed them in order to begin its own foundation once again on a larger and more intense scale. Pushing back limits was the act of American capitalism, the American Dream, taken up by Israel and the dream of Greater Israel on Arab territory, on the backs of the Arabs.</p>
        <p>How the Palestinian people learned to resist and are resisting; how a people of ancient lineage became an armed nation; how they gave themselves a body which didn't simply represent them but embodied them, outside their territory and without a state: all these events demanded a great historical character, one who, we might say from a Western point of view, could have stepped out of Shakespeare, and that was Arafat. It wasn't the first time in history that something like this has happened (the French can think of Free France, except for the fact that it had a smaller popular base at the beginning). And all the occasions on which a solution or element of solution was possible, occasions that the Israelis have deliberately, knowingly destroyed, are not happening for the first time in history either. The Israelis held onto their religious position of denying not only the Palestinian right but also the Palestinian fact. They cleansed themselves of their own terrorism by treating the Palestinians as terrorists from outside. And precisely because the Palestinians were not that, but rather were a specific people as different from other Arabs as Europeans can be among themselves, they could expect only ambiguous aid from the Arab states themselves, aid which sometimes turned back into hostility and extermination when the Palestinian model became dangerous for them. The Palestinians have run through all the infernal cycles of history: the failure of solutions each time they were possible, the worst reversals of alliance of which they bore the brunt, the most solemn promises not kept. And on all this their resistance had to nourish itself.</p>
        <p>It may well be that one of the goals of the Sabra and Shatila massacres was to discredit Arafat. He only consented to the departure of the combatants, the force of which remained intact, on condition that the security of their families be absolutely guaranteed by the United States and even by Israel. After the massacres he had no other word than "shame." If the ensuing crisis for the PLO resulted, in more or less the long term, either in an integration into an Arab state or in a dissolution into Muslim fundamentalism, then it could be said that the Palestinian people had effectively disappeared. But this would be in such conditions that the world, the United States and even Israel would not finish regretting the lost occasions, including those that still remain possible today. To Israel's arrogant formula, "We are not a people like others," the Palestinians have not stopped responding with the cry that was invoked in the first issue of the <i>Revue d'&Eacute;tudes Palestiniennes</i>: "we are a people like others, we only want to be that...."</p>
        <p>By leading the terrorist war in Lebanon, Israel believed it could suppress the PLO and deprive it of the support of the Palestinian people, already deprived of their land. And perhaps it is succeeding, since in surrounded Tripoli there is nothing more than the physical presence of Arafat among his own, all in a sort of solitary grandeur. But the Palestinian people will not lose their identity without creating in its place a double terrorism, of the state and of religion, which will profit from their disappearance and render impossible any peaceful settlement with Israel. From the war in Lebanon Israel itself will not escape merely morally divided and economically disorganized, it will find itself faced with the mirror image of its own intolerance. A political solution, a peaceful settlement is possible only with an independent PLO which will not have disappeared into an already existing state and will not be lost among the diverse Islamic movements. The disappearance of the PLO would only be a victory for the blind forces of war, indifferent to the survival of the Palestinian people.</p>

        <h2>"Wherever they can see it" - Gilles Deleuze (1988)</h2>
        <p>Europe did not start paying its infinite debt to the Jews; it rather made another people, an innocent one&#8212;the Palestinians&#8212;pay back.</p>
        <p>The Zionists have built the state of Israel with the recent past of their suffering and upon the unforgettable European horror&#8212;but also upon the suffering of this other people and with this other people's stones. The Irgoun was dubbed terrorist not only because it used to blast the British headquarters, but also because it wiped out entire villages, such as Deir Yasin.</p>
        <p>The Americans made of Israel a super-production in the Hollywood manner: they conceived of the land as a <i>terra nullius</i> awaiting the arrival of the ancient Hebrews, its only occupants being a few Arab settlers keeping guard over the place's sleeping stones. In this way, they were pushing the Palestinians toward oblivion. They want them to acknowledge the legal existence of Israel, while the Israelis disavow the palpable reality of the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Alone, the Palestinian people have been waging an unfinished war to defend their land, their stones, and their life. It is a war no one talks about, because it is important to maintain the fallacy that the Palestinians are Arabs who came from elsewhere, and could very well return there. However, who will disentangle all these Jordans? Who will tell them [the Zionists, the Americans, and the Europeans] that while ties between the Palestinians and other Arabs may be very strong, they are no stronger than the ties existing between two European countries? Which Palestinian will forget what, besides Israel, other Arabs have inflicted on him or her? What is the knot of this new debt? Exiled from their land, the Palestinians put up wherever they are able to at least narrate their land and keep their vision of it as a last thread of their identity that has been relegated to the realm of dreams. Never will the Israelis manage to push them any further, or to chase them into the night, into oblivion.</p>
        <p>Destroying villages, blowing up houses, exiling inhabitants, assassinating people: this is the toll that a horrifying history has unraveled at the expense of a new innocent people. One hears that Israeli intelligence is much admired by the entire world; but what kind of democracy is that whose political life is too much entwined with the activity of its intelligence services? How can Israel extricate itself from this; from both its annexed and occupied territories; from its settlers and settlements; from its rabid rabbis? Occupation, endless occupation: the hurled stones come from inside, from the Palestinian people, as a reminder that somewhere in the world&#8212;no matter how small it is&#8212;the debt has becom reversed. The Palestinians throw their stones, the living stones of their land. Men are born out of these stones. No one can pay his debt by murders, one, two, three, seven, ten daily, or by striking deals with anyone other than the people directly concerned. The others may choose to eschew their responsibility, but every dead person calls on the living. The Palestinians have struck deep into the soul of Israel. They are at work on it fathoming and traversing it every day.</p>
